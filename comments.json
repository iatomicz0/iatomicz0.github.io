This work is fundamental for the resumption of business, which will be prosperous in 2022."

All teams involved at BASF, from operational to higher level, spared no effort so that their client would not have a line stop problem. What was protected was fulfilled to solve your customer's problem. Material arrived in time so that we didn't have trouble in our line. But I still can't give a 10 because I would like to see the 8D response dynamics meeting our specific Req deadline. In other words, all complaints with Basf do not meet our standard 10-day action plan."

With the consequent table increases, since June until now I have been paying for Suvinil's spaghetti the same amount that is being sold in the market, I have already sent several quotations, home center prints, budgets from non-select clients and clients of distribution, where they can sell the product at the price I'm buying. The answer is always the same, they will increase, but how does someone manage to sell a product for so long for the same purchase price and it's not just spaghetti, we have classic, enamel, etc..\n This makes the margin of the Suvinil brand practically unsustainable for a Select customer that fulfills its objective agreement on a monthly basis.\n Including the profitability. some items at the suggested price by suvinil itself, the margin is well below 30%. I ask, can anyone work with products (several products) with a margin below 30%? Today for science I need a margin of at least 36%.\n I compete face to face with large stores that have a well-considered differential in terms of purchase price and much smaller stores, managed by the owners and family members, with a very similar cost price. See how my scenario is and I don't see any action to improve. In other words, in the commercial policy that I have been following, you are a large retailer or you have to be a micro retailer. We also have the issue of distribution, which sells products cheaper than the factory. Do not be unworthy, this is a fact and proven.\n Anyway, I've been a Suvinil partner for over 15 years, I work the whole line and defend the brand, but unfortunately and based on what I said above among other things, lately our partnership is very unilateral.\n Big hug, good business and I hope that together we can improve this, PARTNERSHIP."

Unfortunately, we were unable to honor all commitments within the agreed deadline. Aid was offered and the outstanding balance was financed, with financial cost, until June this year. We had the promise that they would gradually restore our credit according to the payments. However, since last year we were only allowed to buy in cash (with 5 days and a credit limit of R $ 10,000 per store), causing us difficulty in working with the brand, causing the stores to run out of Suvinil. We find this attitude inelegant because we have always been recognized in the market as examples of a Basf customer and the lack of credit has caused us great embarrassment. We were forced to appeal to other suppliers to ensure the stores' survival. Even though we are a customer with a potential of one million liters, we believe that we have not been treated correctly by the company's financial sector. I am hurt and so are my employees because we are passionate about Suvinil.

I have 2 stores, one in Paraopeba which is in the Central region of Minas, 100km from BH and the other store is in Varzea da Palma in the North region of Minas, they are different regions and I think there should be different consultants, because my consultant who is from the northern region of minas is not able to serve me well here in Paraopeba, I am not having the necessary assistance, because so many of my competitors with purchasing power much higher than mine and competitors with purchasing power much lower than mine are managing to offer their products in a way that I can't compete, it's getting complicated to work this way. I had plans to open another branch, but due to the lack of assistance and the difficulties they are encountering, I find it impracticable to try to work in another store with Suvinil. In 8 years in the store I have never been so difficult to sell my product, because BASF requires a lot of goals, I try to beat them all, but the goals are very exaggerated and hard to beat, because I have bought too much product, no need to hit the goal and they are not managing to sell much, because the competition is offering their products almost equal to my purchase price."

This new system of placing one RTV per channel sucks, prices are unadjusted by region and we are totally without support (I'm not taking into account telephones, but technical visits).

Basf supported us technically very well Mr Tadeu followed the online tests and confirmed the origin of the problem, however Basf left something to be desired in the dynamics of replacement responses with Donaldson. It was an extremely stressful process because I didn't feel the commitment to solve the problem in restocking the new batch.\n Several obstacles were created for the customer as the BASF system is completely plastered for this type of customer support.\n Another factor taking into account this same problem is the same BASF department where they need the Invoice to request transport for non-conforming material removal that is taking up space and generating another inconvenience for their customer. In my view, as I had informed the number of drums and the weight, it was only necessary to schedule the removal of the material with your supplier because the NF Donaldson removal process does not take more than 24 hours.\n More critical was the dynamic line-stop support with Donaldson.\n But I would like to emphasize the good technical support work that Tadeu Nicodemus Ribeiro has been doing with Donaldson. Every time we needed his support he was always helpful and punctual with his customer."

From my perspective, unfair trade policy:\n a) Small BASF store with reduced portfolio buying 6% cheaper through the Mundial distributor (campaigns buy 10 cans and get 1);\n b) New entrant (MC Paints) buying up to 14% cheaper;\n\n * Consequently, 2019 was the year in which we granted the largest discount on Suvinil products, causing a drop in margin and the need to recover this loss of profitability in other suppliers.\n\n c) 90-day interest-free period for the competitor;\n d) Sales in the old table 30 days after the table was turned over with the competitor's justification for not having a DC (Distribution Center). Inconsistency because whoever invests in the business (who has CD) is penalized.\n e) Weakening of the ELO program. Lack of transparency or perception of management policy in sight.\n f) Commercial and strategic proposal less attractive than other suppliers in the segment.\n\n 2. There is a need for better training of the sales team\n a) When questioning the price difference that the competitor practices in selling to the consumer, the answer is another question: \"Do you know the volume that MC buys nationwide?\". There is inconsistency because obviously the participation of the new entrant in GO is smaller. And regional players do not compete in other markets (such as SP);\n b) There is no gratitude when the goals are reached, but there is a very aggressive and hostile demand when they are not; A real connection between sell in and sell out is missing. If you don't sell due to unfair commercial policy, it's no use charging sell in.\n c) The team lacks the value of simplicity.\n\n 3. There is a lack of better training for the merchandising team\n a) Merchandising promoter rated all stores in the chain with a star on Google;\n b) Lack of professionalism with excessive proximity (case manager Rosimeire / Castelo Branco store: \"Good morning, brunette / beautiful marvelous\");\n c) Rudeness in the reopening of the T-63 store when using a product with the label of Melotintas' biggest competitor (Unitintas) in the application of products to a large number of final consumers and painters.\n d) Very low involvement in the reopening of the store: Arrived late, all wet/sweaty, did not do the texture and color plates (texture and color palette); On the eve, we hired a painter to make the Marble and Touch of Glitter apps.\n e) No involvement in the new store (Castelo Branco).\n\n 4. From a strategic point of view:\n a) Conflict with the Distribution channel lasts for more than 5 years: Channel that has no success cases in the segment in the region of Goiânia. There are several cases of failure both with Suvinil products (Luma, Mécari, Mundial) and with other brands (3M, Renner, etc.); On average, the business barely reached 5 years.\n b) Low historical knowledge in the region: Common characteristic of those who were leaders in the region (Coral, Suvinil, Leinertex): all without the distribution channel, buying with a transparent and coherent policy."

It seems that there is a sales policy, but it is not followed. We are tired of seeing resellers selling at very low prices, prices that it is impossible to keep up with. My score is 4 because the company has good, quality products, a product that I do want to have in my store and that I do want to sell. But unfortunately, the negotiation, the ways in which the goals are imposed, without any concern for the customer's needs, has generated a great deal of dissatisfaction in relation to Basf.
